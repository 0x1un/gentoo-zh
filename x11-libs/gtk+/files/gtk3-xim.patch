Subject: [PATCH] xi2: Handle XIM modules that replace events
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Fixes BugÂ 645993 - XIM has wierd behaviors. Some XIM modules
filter every key event, possibly replacing it with their own
one. These events usually have serial=0, so make
GdkDeviceManagerXI2 also listen on these.
